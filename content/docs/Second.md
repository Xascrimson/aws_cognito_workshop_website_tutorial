Ensure you have the following installed. 

1. Yarn - the project will be using yarn, but npm would fit as well, but the ws will be using yarn.

2. Npm

3. node.js

and the packages. Do yarn add ... or npm install ... , but if you are working with one package manager use only that manager.

4. aws-sdk
